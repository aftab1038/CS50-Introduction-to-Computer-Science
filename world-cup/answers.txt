Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?:
With the increase of number of simulations the result is getting more accurate

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?:
it seems like the predictions stabilized after about 100 simulations
